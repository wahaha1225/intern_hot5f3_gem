    "Under the minimal MBM medium with only glucose supplied, the model had to add many reactions to satisfy biomass demands for cofactors/vitamins and respiratory cofactors. Most additions are exchange and transport chains for compounds like riboflavin, folate, and nicotinamide (EX_* plus corresponding tex/t2 transporters), together with biosynthetic steps (e.g., thiamine/thiazole ring, ubiquinone precursors, heme, etc.). Many entries lack GPR, suggesting orphan gap-fills that compensate for missing annotations or assume external supply. Whether to keep uptake or instead complete de novo synthesis should be decided based on the actual medium composition.\n",

    "ATCC_lac_D:\n",
    "With the richer ATCC medium using lactate as the carbon source, only a few reactions were added—the essentials for lactate utilization: lactate exchange (EX_lac__D_e), a proton symport transporter (D_LACt2), and an oxidation step linked to lactate/glyoxylate handling (e.g., GLYOX2). The small number of additions indicates that ATCC and prior steps already met most cofactor requirements; the remaining bottleneck was substrate-specific transport and the first oxidative conversion needed to route lactate into central metabolism."
