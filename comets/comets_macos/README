To install COMETS on a MacOS system, first unpack comets with:

tar zxvf comets_linux.tar.gz

in a directory of your choice. 

This should create a directory <path_to_install>/comets_macos
where <path_to_install> is the directory where you chose to install. 
If you do it in your home directory, typically this will end up being 
/Users/username/comets_macos where 'username' is your username.

To finish the installation add these lines to your .zshrc file:

export COMETS_HOME=<path_to_install>/comets_macos/comets_2.12.3/
export PATH=$PATH:$COMETS_HOME
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$COMETS_HOME/lib/cometspy-master/

where you will replace <path_to_install> with the actuall path as explained above. 
Typically this will be /Users/username/ where 'username' is your username.

Don't forget to source your .zshrc file with:

.   ~/.zshrc

Once you installed, go to <path_to_install>/comets_macos/comets_2.12.3/examples 
and either try to run the jupyter notebook P1_test_tube_aerobic.ipynb
or go to <path_to_install>/comets_macos/comets_2.12.3/examples/Ecoli_core_glop
and run:

./comets_scr comets_script

to try COMETS.
