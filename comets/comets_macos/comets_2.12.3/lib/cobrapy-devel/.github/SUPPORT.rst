* The mailing list is a good place to ask about general modeling questions.
  Please use Google's excellent search capabilities before posting a new
  question. By writing a well formulated question, with sufficient detail, you
  are much more likely to quickly receive a good answer! Please refer to these
  `StackOverflow guidelines <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask>`_ on how
  to ask questions.  `Google Group <http://groups.google.com/group/cobra-pie>`_
* There is the cobrapy `gitter chat <https://gitter.im/opencobra/cobrapy>`_ where
  you can ask questions as well. It is a bit more developer-centric than the
  mailing list.
* You can post questions in `GitHub issues
  <https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/issues>`_, too. Please reserve this
  channel for code problems and reserve conceptual questions for the mailing
  list.
