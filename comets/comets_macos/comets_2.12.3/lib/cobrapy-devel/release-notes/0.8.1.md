# Release notes for cobrapy 0.8.1

## Fixes

- Fix bug related to inhomogeneous sampling
  [#558](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/issues/558).  During
  flux sampling, store the nullspace rather than the entire projection
  (N * N.T) which reduces the memory footprint since it uses memory in
  the order of `2 * n_reaction * n_metabolites` instead of `4 *
  n_reactions^2` (no change in
  speed). [PR #556](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/pull/556)
