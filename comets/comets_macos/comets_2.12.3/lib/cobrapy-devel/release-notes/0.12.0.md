# Release notes for cobrapy 0.12.0

## New features

* Add geometric FBA as a method.
* Add (linear) ROOM as a flux simulation method.
* Allow a reference solution to be used with deletion methods when using MOMA or
  ROOM.

## Fixes

* Extend MOMA docstrings and add references.
* Vastly improve the time needed for adding MOMA/ROOM constraints.
* Copy metabolites added from other models.
* Change `.summary` methods to use a fractional threshold.
* Fix unexpected behavior in loopless FBA.
* Some internal improvements related to dependencies and continuous integration.

## Backwards incompatible changes

* The `find_essential_*` functions no longer accept a reference solution. As
  their method of choice *FBA* doesn't accept one anyway.
