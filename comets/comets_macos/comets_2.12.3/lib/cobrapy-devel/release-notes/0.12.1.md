# Release notes for cobrapy 0.12.1

## New features

* Fix/feature that allows summaries to work properly for models with multiple
  exchange reactions for the same metabolite.
* Require a later optlang version so that Gurobi can now be used for quadratic
  problems.
* cobrapy can now extract primal values from a wider range of solver states.
  This is particularly useful to investigate problems in non-optimal states.

## Fixes

* Test different solvers on more text cases than previously.
* Improve the way benchmarks are run.
* Restore automatic documentation builds on readthedocs.org.
* Correct a problem in how geomtric FBA retrieved solutions.
* Update the use of pandas interface of the sampler.
* Correct the sanity checks for the new ROOM implementation.

## Deprecated features

## Backwards incompatible changes

* cobrapy functions that return solution only raise `OptimizationError`s rather
  than also potentially raising a `RuntimeError`.
* Linear MOMA is the new default method. It used to be MOMA which excludes GLPK
  as a solver due to being a quadratic optimization problem.
