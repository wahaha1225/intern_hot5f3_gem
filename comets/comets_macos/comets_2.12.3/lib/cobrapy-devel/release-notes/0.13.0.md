# Release notes for cobrapy 0.13.0

## New features

* New properties for the `cobra.Model` that give access to specific boundary
  reactions.
* New functions for handling media and computing minimal media. Please read the
  new documentation chapter on media.

## Backwards incompatible changes

* The model class has gained new properties `exchanges`, `demands`,
  `sinks`, and `boundary`. `boundary` mirrors the previous behavior of
  `exchanges` whereas the other properties return the more specific boundary
  reactions.
