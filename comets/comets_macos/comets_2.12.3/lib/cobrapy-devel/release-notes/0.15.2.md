# Release notes for cobrapy 0.15.2

## New features

* We introduce a new `tolerance` attribute both on the global `Configuration`
  object as well as `Model`. The default for this is 1E-07. Many functions that
  use a zero cut-off will now use the set model tolerance value by default.
  This value can still be set manually via function arguments but attempting to
  set a threshold that is lower than the model tolerance now raises an error.

## Fixes

* Geometric FBA now has a `processes` argument with a default of 1 which can be
  used for parallel processing.
* Clean up the sampling code and make it respect global defaults.
* Many SBML improvements, please see #835 for details.
